# GitHub setup
1. Sign in to GitHub and navigate to the [starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/fork), top left - press the green drop down button "Use this template" and ~~select "Create a new repository"~~ create new fork (I will try to add some comment and explanationm later). 
2. In the "Repository" field - enter your GitHub name and add "github.io" as the domain. For me it was "klmngit.github.com". 

> Please remember about the domain - otherwise the website will work locally, but won't be validated by the GitHub Actions HTML-proofer. Keep it as the public.

# Docker 
## 
1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Install [Visual Studiio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Install [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for VSCode.
4. Clone your new repo into Docker container volume: in VSCode press F1 and run "Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume" command.

# Jekyll server
If Docker container is cloned correctly - run in this container VSCode terminal and start Jekyll serwer with:
```terminal
bundle exec jekyll s
```
New instance should be generated and webserver should be listening @ http://localhost:4000 - open your browser and check it !
Here you can see an example Terminal output from my server:
```terminal
